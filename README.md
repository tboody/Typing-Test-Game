# Typing-Test-Game
This Python program uses curses to create a typing speed test in the terminal. It prompts users to type randomly chosen text accurately, measuring their words per minute (WPM).
The test begins upon any key press and ends when the entire text is correctly typed or the ESC key is pressed. Users can continue with new tests or exit by pressing ESC, 
receiving real-time feedback on their typing accuracy and speed.
